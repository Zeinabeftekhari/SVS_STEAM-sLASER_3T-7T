#ZE and TBS - CV calculation for metabolites
# This script processes metabolite data to remove outliers and calculate the coefficient of variation (CV)
# for different combinations of experimental variables (metabolites, sequences, fields, and locations).
# The CV is a measure of relative variability, calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, 
# expressed as a percentage. The script follows these main steps:
# 
# 1. Load the necessary libraries for data manipulation.
# 2. Define the file paths for the input and output CSV files.
# 3. Read the input CSV file and filter out rows where the CRLB (Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound) exceeds 50.
# 4. Write the filtered data to a new CSV file.
# 5. Load the filtered data and extract relevant columns.
# 6. Identify unique metabolites, sequences, fields, locations, and subjects present in the dataset.
# 7. Calculate the CV for each subject based on the different combinations of metabolite, sequence, field, and location,
#    and store these values in a 'subject CV' table.
# 8. Calculate the mean CV across all subjects for each combination of experimental variables and store these in a 'mean CV' table.
# 9. Save the 'subject CV' table and the 'mean CV' table as separate CSV files.
